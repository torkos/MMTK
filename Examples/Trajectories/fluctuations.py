# Calculate atomic fluctuations from a trajectory.
#
# The trajectory file contains a protein. The fluctuations are calculated
# for all atoms, and then the average over the C-alpha atoms is determined.
# Note that calculating the fluctuations for only the C-alpha atoms is
# more complicated and no faster.
#
# This example illustrates:
# 1) Reading trajectory files
# 2) Selecting parts of a system
# 3) Calculating trajectory averages
