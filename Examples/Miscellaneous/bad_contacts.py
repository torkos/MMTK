# Find bad contacts in a protein structure
#
# This script identifies that atoms in a protein structure
# that have the highest forces acting on them after a few
# steps of minimization.
#
# Note that there are no bad contacts in the example protein.
# The gradient norm values printed by this script can thus be
# used as a reference for what is normal.
